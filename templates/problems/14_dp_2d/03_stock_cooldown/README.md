## Description

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`-th day. Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restriction: after you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day). Note that you may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (you must sell the stock before you buy again).

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,0,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [1]
Output: 0
Explanation: Only one day, no transaction possible.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: prices = [1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: Buy on day 0, sell on day 1 for profit of 1.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= prices.length <= 5000`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`

## Function Signature

**Go:**

```go
func maxProfitCooldown(prices []int) int
```

**Python:**
```python
def max_profit_cooldown(prices: List[int]) -> int:
```
