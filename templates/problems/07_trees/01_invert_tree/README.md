- **Link**: [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/problems/invert-a-binary-tree) | [LeetCode 226](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)

## Description

Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree and return its root. Inverting a binary tree means swapping every left child with its corresponding right child at every node in the tree, effectively creating a mirror image of the original tree.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

![Example 1](assets/invert1-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]
Explanation: Every left and right child pair is swapped. Node 2 and 7 swap, then 1 and 3 swap, and 6 and 9 swap.
```

**Example 2:**

![Example 2](assets/invert2-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,3,1]
Explanation: The left child 1 and right child 3 are swapped.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
Explanation: An empty tree remains empty after inversion.
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Function Signature

**Go:**

```go
func invertTree(root *TreeNode) *TreeNode
```

**Python:**
```python
def invert_tree(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
```
